   cd python-analysis-project
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Unzip the dataset (if not already unzipped):

   ```bash
   unzip data/houses-in-london.zip -d data/
   ```

## Usage

Run the analysis script:

```bash
python analysis.py
```
